Recursive Insertion Sort

Difficulty Level : Easy

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

Below is an iterative algorithm for insertion sort

How to implement it recursively?
Recursive Insertion Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Insertion Sort and recursion.
If we take a closer look at Insertion Sort algorithm, we keep processed elements sorted and insert new elements one by one in the inserted array.
Recursion Idea.

Base Case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return.

Recursively sort first n-1 elements.

Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array.
